1 . Nick works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

    For example, there are
    n = 7 socks with colors
    ar  = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.

    Complete the sock merchant function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of matching pairs of socks that are available.
    sockMerchant has the following parameter(s):
    n : the number of socks in the pile
    ar : the colors of each sock

    Input Format  
    The first line contains an integer n , the number of socks represented in ar .

    The second line contains n
    socks in the pile. Constraints
    1 ≤  n  ≤ 100
    space-separated integers describing the colors ar [ i ] of the

    1 ≤ ar [ i ] ≤ 100 where 0 ≤ i < n
    Output Format
    Return the total number of matching pairs of socks that Nick can sell.

Answer :

function stockAndCount( n, arr ) {
    let pairs = 0;
    //reduce the array to single value
    const colors = arr.reduce((acc, val) => {
        (!!acc[val]) ? acc[val] += 1 : acc[val] = 1;
        return acc;
    }, {});
    // loop for object
    Object.keys(colors).forEach( n => {
        let _pair = parseInt( colors[n] / 2);
        if ( _pair >= 1 ) pairs += _pair;
    });
      //return number of paired shoes
    document.write(pairs);  
}
 //example function call
var n = 5
var array = [2,2,1,1,3]

stockAndCount( n, array )



2. There is an input number: 1.345.679
Write pseudo code (use javascript) that produces following output:

1000000
300000
40000
5000
600
70
9


Answer :

function moro2 (n) {
  //input into string
  var string = n.toString()
  //loop as many as string.length
    for (var i = 0; i <= string.length; i++) {
        // loop for every row value
        for (var j = string.length-1; j >= i; j--) {
          //if string.length - 1 = j its mean the first value of the row from the left
          j == string.length-1 ? document.write(string.charAt(i)):document.write('0');
            
        }
        //break the line
        document.write('<br>');   
    }
}
moro2(1345679);



3 . Andrew walks through 100 switches from point A to point B with 1 to 100 as the number. At the first trip, Andrew presses all of the switches so lamps are on. Second trip, Andrew only presses switches that multiplying of two. The next trip, Andrew presses switches that multiplying of three. Andrew repeats his trips from A to B for 100 times. Write down the code to determine how many lamps will turn on after 100 trips from A to B.
